# My Java Journal

Been meaning to do this for a while, to put together a collection of all
the things I've learning the as I go along.

I will back track to cover some pretty important foundational principles that I've learned
In java programming and also tips and patterns I've noticed, learned or been told that
have helped remove a lot of the rod blocks on my path of learning.

Also I just general bits that I wish were explained differently when I first encountered them,
but that I now understand and wish to retain and remember.
