# Functional Programming

##What is it?

Functional Programming is a programming paradigm (ideologoy) where one tries to avoid the use of state change in functions (treating all data as immutable [unchanging]).

The reason for this is that most of the difficulties we face in programming is actually to do with tracking state changes.
